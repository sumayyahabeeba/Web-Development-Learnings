<!--NOTE: AVOID USING INLINE CSS, USE INTERNAL CSS ONLY IF YOUR WEBPAGE IS TOO BASIC AND REQUIRES LESS STYLING, ANOTHER USE CASE OF INTERNAL CSS IS THAT WHEN WE WORK WITH BOOTSTRAP AND REQUIRE LESS CSS IN OUR CODE HENCE GO WITH THE INTERNAL CSS. REST FOR OTHER HUGE PROJECTS GO WITH THE EXTERNAL CSS SO THAT THE NEAT CODE IS MAINTAINED AND IF THE WORK IS DIVIDED AMONG THE GROUP THEN PARALLELY THE WORK CAN BE HANDLED. -->
